<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Narendra Choudhary, a passionate learner and creative thinker with a strong foundation in Technology.<br/> Iâ€™m currently pursuing my B.Tech at M.L.V. Textile Engineering College. Alongside my academic journey, Iâ€™m exploring new horizons in front-end development, driven by my interest in technology and design.</p>

<p>Creativity has always been at the heart of what I do. Whether itâ€™s sketching portraits, working on canvas, or designing solutions, I bring dedication, honesty, and a keen eye for detail to every project. Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me playing cricket, kabaddi, or experimenting with innovative ideas.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m fluent in Hindi and English, and Iâ€™m excited to combine my technical knowledge, creative skills, and emerging coding expertise to build user-friendly digital experiences.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together! ðŸŒŸ</p>
